# Crash & Performance Monitoring

## What is Crash & Performance Monitoring?

Crash & Performance Monitoring refers to tools and techniques used to detect, report, and analyze crashes and performance issues in Android applications. These tools help developers identify bugs, optimize app performance, and enhance the overall user experience by providing insights into app behavior under different conditions.

## Why is it Important?

- **Identify Issues:** Detect and resolve bugs and crashes that users encounter.
- **Optimize Performance:** Monitor app performance to ensure smooth and responsive user experience.
- **Improve Quality:** Use insights from crash reports and performance data to make informed decisions and improvements.
- **User Retention:** Reduce app crashes and performance issues to maintain user satisfaction and engagement.

## How to Implement Crash & Performance Monitoring

### 1. **Integrate Crash Reporting Tools**
   - **Firebase Crashlytics**: Provides real-time crash reporting and analytics.
   - **Sentry**: Offers comprehensive crash and error monitoring.

### 2. **Set Up Performance Monitoring**
   - **Firebase Performance Monitoring**: Helps track and analyze app performance metrics such as app startup time, network latency, and screen rendering times.

### 3. **Monitor App Behavior**
   - **Custom Logging**: Implement logging to track app behavior and performance metrics.
   - **Profiling Tools**: Use Android Studio’s profiler to monitor CPU, memory, and network usage.

## Prebuilt Classes and Interfaces

### Firebase Crashlytics

#### **1. Crashlytics**
- **Description:** A class that provides methods to log events and report crashes.
- **Usage:** Use this class to report non-fatal errors and manually log events.
- **Code Example:**
  ```java
  // Log a custom event
  FirebaseCrashlytics.getInstance().log("User clicked button");

  // Report a non-fatal exception
  FirebaseCrashlytics.getInstance().recordException(new Exception("Custom exception"));
  ```

### Firebase Performance Monitoring

#### **1. FirebasePerformance**
- **Description:** Provides access to performance monitoring features.
- **Usage:** Use this class to start and stop performance traces.
- **Code Example:**
  ```java
  // Start a performance trace
  Trace trace = FirebasePerformance.getInstance().newTrace("my_trace");
  trace.start();

  // Stop the trace
  trace.stop();
  ```

### Android Profiler (Android Studio)

#### **1. CPU Profiler**
- **Description:** Monitors CPU usage and identifies performance bottlenecks.
- **Usage:** Use this profiler to analyze CPU performance and optimize code.
- **Code Example:** Use Android Studio’s built-in profiler tool.

#### **2. Memory Profiler**
- **Description:** Tracks memory usage and detects memory leaks.
- **Usage:** Use this profiler to monitor memory allocation and garbage collection.
- **Code Example:** Use Android Studio’s built-in profiler tool.

#### **3. Network Profiler**
- **Description:** Monitors network requests and data usage.
- **Usage:** Use this profiler to analyze network traffic and performance.
- **Code Example:** Use Android Studio’s built-in profiler tool.

## Key Methods

### **log()**
- **Description:** Logs custom events or messages to the crash reporting tool.
- **Usage:** Use this method to provide context or details about events in the app.
- **Code Example:** See `Crashlytics` example above.

### **recordException()**
- **Description:** Records non-fatal exceptions and reports them to the crash reporting tool.
- **Usage:** Use this method to capture and report exceptions that do not crash the app.
- **Code Example:** See `Crashlytics` example above.

### **start() / stop()**
- **Description:** Starts and stops performance traces to measure app performance.
- **Usage:** Use these methods to measure the time taken by specific operations or code sections.
- **Code Example:** See `FirebasePerformance` example above.

## Real-Life Examples

1. **Crash Reporting with Firebase Crashlytics:**
   - Automatically capture and report crashes, with detailed reports on the stack trace, device information, and user actions leading up to the crash.

   **Code Example:**
   ```java
   FirebaseCrashlytics.getInstance().recordException(new Exception("Error details"));
   ```

2. **Performance Monitoring with Firebase Performance:**
   - Measure and analyze the time taken for network requests and screen rendering to identify performance bottlenecks.

   **Code Example:**
   ```java
   Trace trace = FirebasePerformance.getInstance().newTrace("network_trace");
   trace.start();
   
   // Perform network operation
   
   trace.stop();
   ```

3. **Memory Leak Detection:**
   - Use the Memory Profiler to detect and fix memory leaks in your application, ensuring efficient memory usage.

   **Code Example:** Use Android Studio’s profiler tool to identify and analyze memory leaks.

4. **Network Performance Analysis:**
   - Monitor network requests to optimize data usage and improve response times.

   **Code Example:** Use Android Studio’s Network Profiler to analyze network traffic and performance.

## Summary

Crash & Performance Monitoring tools are essential for maintaining the quality and performance of Android applications. By integrating tools like Firebase Crashlytics and Firebase Performance Monitoring, and using Android Studio’s profiling tools, developers can effectively identify and resolve issues, optimize performance, and enhance the user experience.
